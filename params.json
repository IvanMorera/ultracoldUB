  "body": "## Ultracold UB\r\nThe project Ultracold UB starts as a collaborative project intended to be carried out by last year undergraduate students supervised by professors and researchers. The idea is to build a user friendly software to introduce high-school students and undergrads into the fields of quantum mechanics, ultracold atomic physics, Bose-Einstein condensates and non-linear solitons. \r\n\r\nThe main objectives of the project are manifold: \r\n\r\n- Foster cooperation among last year undergraduate students\r\n- Bring last year students closer to the research carried out in our department\r\n- Produce a useful tool for Science popularisation at high school level\r\n\r\n## Main structure of the project \r\nThe package will contain initially three modules. \r\n- Quantum mechanics module. To exemplify some basic aspects of quantum mechanics\r\n- Bright solitons module. Allows the user to play with Bright solitons pinched on a 1D Bose-Einstein condensate\r\n- Dark solitons module. Allows the user to play with a dark soliton pinched on a 1D Bose-Einstein condensate\r\n\r\n## Authors and Contributors\r\nThis project was started in the summer of 2016. The main contributors in 2016 are:\r\n\r\n- Maria Arazo (@maarsa)  \r\n- Carlos Bravo \r\n- Albert Gallemí\r\n- Muntsa Guilleumas \r\n- Bruno Julia (@brunojulia)\r\n- Ricardo Mayol (@Payayo) \r\n- Ivan Morera (@IvanMorera) \r\n- Antonio Muñoz (@antoniommateo) \r\n- Artur Polls \r\n- Alejandro Romero (@Alejandro-23) \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n",
